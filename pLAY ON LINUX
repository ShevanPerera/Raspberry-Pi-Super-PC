Method 1: PlayOnLinux (Recommended for Ease)
Step 1: Install Dependencies
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install playonlinux wine winetricks
Step 2: Install Box86/Box64 (ARM Support)
Since PlayOnLinux uses Wine, and Wine needs x86 emulation on ARM:

bash
# For Pi 4/5 (64-bit OS recommended):
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64
cd box64 && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DRPI4=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
sudo make install

# For 32-bit OS (Pi 3 or older):
git clone https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86
cd box86 && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DRPI4=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
sudo make install
Step 3: Run PlayOnLinux
bash
playonlinux
Step 4: Install GTA San Andreas
Open PlayOnLinux → Click Install.

Search for "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" (if available) or choose "Install a non-listed program".

Select Windows 10 (or XP) as the Wine version.

Install from:

DVD: Mount the ISO or insert the disc.

Digital Installer: Run the setup .exe (e.g., from Steam).

Follow the installer steps.

Step 5: Apply Necessary Fixes
Silent Patch (Optional): Download the Silent Patch for bug fixes.

Run in Low Settings: Set resolution to 800x600 for better performance.

Method 2: Manual Wine + Box86/Box64
If PlayOnLinux doesn’t work well, try running GTA SA directly with Wine:

bash
# Install Wine
sudo apt install wine

# Run GTA SA (replace with your .exe path)
box64 wine "path_to_gtasa.exe"
Performance Tweaks
Overclock the Pi (if comfortable) via raspi-config.

Lower In-Game Settings: Disable shadows, reduce draw distance.

Use Gamepad: Some keyboards/mice may lag.

Alternative: Android Version (Easier on Pi)
If the PC version runs poorly, try the Android port via Waydroid (Pi 4/5 only):

bash
sudo apt install waydroid
waydroid init
waydroid session start
# Then install GTA SA APK
