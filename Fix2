If you're encountering "unable to locate package" errors for all libraries (even after running sudo apt update), the issue is likely due to:

1. Incorrect APT Sources List
Your Raspberry Pi OS might be pointing to outdated/wrong repositories.

Fix: Reset APT Sources
bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Replace the contents with:

ini
deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian bullseye main contrib non-free rpi
deb-src http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian bullseye main contrib non-free rpi
Then update:

bash
sudo apt update
2. Raspberry Pi OS Version Mismatch
If you're on Bookworm (Debian 12), some packages have been renamed/removed.

If you're on 64-bit OS, some libraries need different names.

Check Your OS:
bash
lsb_release -a   # Shows Debian version (e.g., Bullseye/Bookworm)
uname -m         # Shows architecture (armv7l = 32-bit, aarch64 = 64-bit)
Solutions:
Issue	Fix
Bookworm (Debian 12)	Use bullseye-backports or compile from source.
64-bit OS	Install :armhf packages manually.
Broken packages	Run sudo apt --fix-broken install.
3. Network/Proxy Issues
If apt update fails entirely:

bash
ping archive.raspbian.org  # Check connectivity
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf # Set DNS to 8.8.8.8 if needed
4. Manual Installation (Last Resort)
If packages are truly missing, download .deb files manually:

bash
wget http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libv/libvorbis/libvorbis-dev_1.3.7-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i libvorbis-dev_1.3.7-1_armhf.deb
Find packages at: Debian Packages

Still Not Working?
Reinstall Raspberry Pi OS (via Imager)

Use Docker (pre-configured environment):

bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gta-modding/re3:latest
