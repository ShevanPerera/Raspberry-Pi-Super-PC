🔑 Fixing "Permission Denied" Error
1. Use sudo for System Files
bash
sudo wget https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/box64.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list
2. Set Correct Permissions
bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list
3. Complete the Installation
Run these commands one by one:

bash
# Add GPG key
wget -qO- https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/KEY.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/box64-debs-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null

# Update packages
sudo apt update

# Install Box64
sudo apt install box64 -y
🚨 Important Notes
Always use sudo when writing to system directories like /etc/

If you get "gpg: command not found", install it first:

bash
sudo apt install gnupg -y
✅ Verification
Check if Box64 installed correctly:

bash
box64 --version
(Should show version like "Box64 v0.2.5")

❌ Still Having Issues?
Check if the file exists:

bash
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list
If missing, try creating the directory first:

bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
💡 Alternative: Manual Download
Download the file as your user:

bash
wget https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/box64.list
Move it with sudo:

bash
sudo mv box64.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
