🛠️ Fixing "Must Explicitly Choose One" Error
1. First, Update Your System
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Install Box64 Manually (Since It's Not in Default Repos)
bash
# Download and install Box64:
wget https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/box64.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/box64.list
wget -qO- https://ryanfortner.github.io/box64-debs/KEY.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/box64-debs-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt update
sudo apt install box64 -y
3. Install Wine64
bash
sudo apt install wine64 -y
✅ Verification
Check if both installed correctly:

bash
box64 --version
wine --version
(Should show version numbers without errors)

🔧 Alternative if Still Not Working
If the above fails, use TwisterOS's pre-installed Wine:

bash
# Just run:
wine /path/to/gta-sa.exe
(TwisterOS usually includes Wine by default—no extra install needed!)

🚨 Important Notes
TwisterOS already includes Wine (check wine --version first before installing).

Box64 may need manual install (as shown above).

If you get "Unable to locate package", ensure your /etc/apt/sources.list has:

bash
deb http://archive.twisteros.com/ twister main
