🔧 Step 1: Open config.txt
Method A: Graphical (File Manager)
Open File Manager (folder icon on the taskbar).

Navigate to:

Standard Raspberry Pi OS: /boot/config.txt

Ubuntu-based OS (like TwisterOS): /boot/firmware/config.txt

Right-click the file → Open with Text Editor.

Method B: Terminal (Nano Editor)
bash
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
(For Ubuntu-based OS, use /boot/firmware/config.txt instead.)

📜 Step 2: Scroll to the VERY Bottom
Press Page Down or scroll with your mouse until you see the last line of text.

Look for blank space below all existing text (this is where you’ll add overclocking settings).

Example of where to add settings (screenshot-like view):

ini
# Existing settings above...
[pi4]
max_framebuffers=2

# 👇 ADD YOUR OVERCLOCK SETTINGS *HERE* (below everything else!) 👇
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2100
gpu_freq=750
force_turbo=1
(If the file is completely empty, just paste the lines at the top.)

💾 Step 3: Save & Exit
Nano Editor:

Press Ctrl + X → Type Y → Press Enter.

GUI Text Editor:

Click File → Save (or Ctrl + S).

⚡ Step 4: Reboot & Verify
bash
sudo reboot
After rebooting, check if overclocking worked:

bash
vcgencmd measure_clock arm
If it shows 2100000000, your Pi is now running at 2.1GHz!

⚠️ Critical Notes
Cooling is mandatory (use a fan/heatsink).

Not all Pi 4Bs can hit 2.1GHz—if unstable, try arm_freq=2000.

force_turbo=1 voids warranty (but gives max performance).

❌ Troubleshooting
Pi won’t boot?

Hold Shift during boot to disable overclocking.

Edit config.txt again and reduce values.

🎯 Final Result
✅ 20-30% faster performance (emulators, games, apps run smoother).
✅ Feels like a "Super Pi" (without buying new hardware).
