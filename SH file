📝 Creating Your First .sh File (3 Methods)
Method 1: Desktop Right-Click (Easiest)
Right-click on desktop → Create New → Blank File

Name it launch_gta.sh (must end with .sh)

Right-click the file → Open With Text Editor

Paste your script (e.g., the GTA:SA launcher code below)

Save (Ctrl+S) and close.

Method 2: Terminal Commands
bash
# 1. Create the file
nano ~/Desktop/launch_gta.sh

# 2. Paste this basic GTA:SA launcher:
#!/bin/bash
cd "/home/pi/Games/GTA_SA"
box64 wine gta-sa.exe -windowed -width 1024 -height 768

# 3. Save: Press Ctrl+X → Y → Enter

# 4. Make executable:
chmod +x ~/Desktop/launch_gta.sh
Method 3: Drag-and-Drop from USB
Create the .sh file on another PC (Notepad++ or VS Code).

Save with Unix line endings (LF, not CRLF).

Copy to Pi desktop via USB.

Right-click → Properties → Permissions → Check "Allow executing".

▶️ Running the Script
Double-click the .sh file → Choose "Execute in Terminal"
(Or run manually in Terminal:)

bash
bash ~/Desktop/launch_gta.sh
🔧 Troubleshooting
Issue	Fix
"Permission denied"	Run chmod +x filename.sh
No .sh option	Use nano or right-click → "Create Document" → "Empty File"
Windows line endings	Run sudo apt install dos2unix then dos2unix file.sh
